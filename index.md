### About Me
I'm currently working as a researcher at The Ohio State University, where I completed my B.S. in Astronomy and Astrophysics with a minor in Computational and Informational Sciences in December of 2020.

My research interests revolve around the field of exoplanets: discovering and characterizing them as well as their host stars. I find it incredibly interesting to imagine how similar or dissimilar other planetary systems are when compared to our own solar system. 

My projects thus far have focused on getting metallicity and elemental abundance data for stars using spectroscopy. Some of the larger pieces of code I've written which I've considered quite useful are listed below. 

### List of Projects
[Useful Links](astroweblist.md): In my limited time in the field of astronomy, I've realized how difficult it is to find things if you don't know exactly where to look. This is a list of websites that I hope will make life easier for those just starting out, and hopefully generally become a useful web index for general astronomical purposes.

[PyKMOD](pykmod.md): This is a Kurucz model atmosphere interpolator for Python, based on the original IDL tool written by Carlos Allende-Prieto.
