### Telescope Data Archives 
[CAHA (Calar Alto Observatory Archive)](http://caha.sdc.cab.inta-csic.es/calto/jsp/searchform.jsp): For mostly raw data from Calar Alto. CARMENES does have reduced data products available, which are also available at the CARMENES-specific archive [here](http://carmenes.cab.inta-csic.es/gto/welcome.action).

[ESO Phase 3 Archive](http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_main/form): For reduced data from the European Southern Observatory.

[ESO Main Data Archive](http://archive.eso.org/eso/eso_archive_main.html): Contains a wider range of instruments, but features only raw, unreduced data.

[Keck Observatory Archive](https://koa.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/KOA/nph-KOAlogin): For raw, unreduced data from the Keck Telescope.

[SMOKA (Subaru Telescope Archive)](https://smoka.nao.ac.jp/): Contains only raw data, and I am unaware of any Subaru-specific data reduction tools.
