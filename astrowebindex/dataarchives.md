### Calar Alto Observatory
[CAHA](http://caha.sdc.cab.inta-csic.es/calto/jsp/searchform.jsp): For mostly raw data from Calar Alto. CARMENES does have reduced data products available, which are also available at the CARMENES-specific archive [here](http://carmenes.cab.inta-csic.es/gto/welcome.action).

### European Southern Observatory (ESO)
[ESO Phase 3 Archive](http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_main/form): For reduced data from the European Southern Observatory.

[ESO Main Data Archive](http://archive.eso.org/eso/eso_archive_main.html): Contains a wider range of instruments, but features only raw, unreduced data.
- [Data reduction tools](https://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/) and an [FAQ page](https://www.eso.org/sci/data-processing/faq.html)

### Gemini Observatory
[Gemini Observatory Archive](https://archive.gemini.edu/searchform/): For raw and reduced data products from the Gemini Observatory

### Infrared Science Archive (NASA/IPAC)
[IRSA Homepage](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/frontpage/): Contains data from numerous telescopes, including but not limited to WISE, 2MASS, Spitzer, and the Planck Telescope.

### Keck Telescope
[Keck Observatory Archive](https://koa.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/KOA/nph-KOAlogin): For raw, unreduced data from the Keck Telescope.

[LBTI Archive](https://lbti.ipac.caltech.edu/): Data from the LBT Interferometer.

### National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO)
[NOIRLab Astro Data Archive](https://astroarchive.noirlab.edu/): Contains data from Kitt Peak, Bok, Cerro Tololo, SOAR, and WIYN Observatories. The new NEID spectrograph at WIYN also has its own data archive [here](https://neid.ipac.caltech.edu/search.php).

[Legacy Data Archive](http://archive1.dm.noao.edu/search/query/): Transitioned to EOL as of June 1, 2021 in favor of NOIRLab AstroArchive. Still usable, but some features may break over time.

### Subaru Telescope
[SMOKA](https://smoka.nao.ac.jp/): Contains only raw data, and I am unaware of any Subaru-specific data reduction tools.
