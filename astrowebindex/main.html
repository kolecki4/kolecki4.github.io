        This page, I hope, will grow into a hub through which astronomers will have a far easier time 
        finding relevant data, software, and more, than having to sift through pages of results and carefully craft 
        search terms on your favorite search engine. This list is always going to be a work in progress, as it is 
        imopssible for one person to keep up with the entirety of the vast field of astronomy, so if you do have 
        suggestions for additions here, email me at jaredkolecki@gmail.com with a link and a short description of 
        it and I'll do my best to categorize it and add it in.
