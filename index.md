### About Me
I'm currently working as a researcher at The Ohio State University, where I completed my B.S. in Astronomy and Astrophysics with a minor in Computational and Informational Sciences in December of 2020.

My research interests revolve around the field of exoplanets: discovering and characterizing them as well as their host stars. I find it incredibly interesting to imagine how similar or dissimilar other planetary systems are when compared to our own solar system. 

My projects thus far have focused on getting metallicity and elemental abundance data for stars using spectroscopy. Some of the larger pieces of code I've written which I've considered quite useful will be uploaded as github repositories at a later date.
