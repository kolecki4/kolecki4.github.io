# Exoplanets


## Planet Signature Detection (RV, Transit, etc)
[Lightkurve](https://docs.lightkurve.org/) (Python, last updated Mar 2021): Utility for downloading & analyzing light curves and target pixel files from Kepler, K-2, and TESS. The developers are actively adding new analysis tools (citation: [???](???)).

[Wotan](https://github.com/hippke/wotan) (Python, last updated Oct 2020): Contains dozens algorithms for reducing, detrending, and analyzing light curve data. (citation: [Hippke et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....158..143H/abstract))

[MulensModel](https://github.com/rpoleski/MulensModel) (Python, last updated Jun 2021): Modeling software for microlensing events which can then be used to compare against observed data (citation: [Poleski & Yi 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26C....26...35P/abstract)).

## Compositional and Dynamical Modeling

[EXOFASTv2](https://github.com/jdeast/EXOFASTv2) (IDL, last updated Jul 2021): Powerful modeling software capable of modeling a planetary system based on input RV, transit, and astrometric data, as well as characterize the system's host star. Also offers a decent set of tutorials for new users (citation: [Eastman et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190709480E/abstract)).

[petitRADTRANS](https://petitradtrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Python, last updated Aug 2021): Software for computing transmission and emission spectra of exoplanets (citation: [Molliere et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...627A..67M/abstract)).
