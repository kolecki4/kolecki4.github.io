# AstroWeb Index

This page, I hope, will grow into a hub through which astronomers will have a far easier time finding relevant data, software, and more, than having to sift through pages of results and carefully craft search terms on your favorite search engine. This list is always going to be a work in progress, as it is imopssible for one man to keep up with the entirety of the vast field of astronomy, so if you do have suggestions for additions here, email me at jaredkolecki@gmail.com with a link and a short description of it and I'll do my best to categorize it and add it in.
