      <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
              I'm currently working as a post-baccalaureate researcher at The Ohio State University,
              where I completed my B.S. in Astronomy and Astrophysics with a minor in Computational
              and Informational Sciences in December of 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
              My interests revolve around the field of exoplanets: discovering and characterizing them
              as well as their host stars. I find it incredibly interesting to imagine how similar or dissimilar
              other planetary systems are when compared to our own solar system. Quantifying how other solar
              systems may differ from our own can allow for deeper insight as to what they are actually like,
              which can produce some very interesting theories and discoveries.
           </p>
          <p>
              My research thus far has focused on getting metallicity and elemental abundance data
              for stars using optical and infrared spectroscopy. In this process, I have been developing
              a framework based around PyMOOGi (Adamow 2017; madamow on Github) which automates much of the
              work associated with getting abundances. This includes calculating equivalent widths, deriving
              stellar parameters, getting an appropriate model atmosphere, running MOOG, and finally,
              calculation of uncertainties. While currently only suitably tested on FGK-dwarfs, my next
              project involves expanding this functionality to include M-dwarfs, as these cool, dim stars
              have become prime targets for exoplanet surveys.
