### Calar Alto Observatory
[CAHA](http://caha.sdc.cab.inta-csic.es/calto/jsp/searchform.jsp): For mostly raw data from Calar Alto. CARMENES does have reduced data products available, which are also available at the CARMENES-specific archive [here](http://carmenes.cab.inta-csic.es/gto/welcome.action).

### Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)
[CFHT Science Archive](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/cfht/) Contains both raw and reduced products.

### European Southern Observatory (ESO)
[ESO Phase 3 Archive](http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_main/form): For reduced data from the European Southern Observatory.

[ESO Main Data Archive](http://archive.eso.org/eso/eso_archive_main.html): Contains a wider range of instruments, but features only raw, unreduced data.
- [Data reduction tools](https://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/) and an [FAQ page](https://www.eso.org/sci/data-processing/faq.html)

### Gemini Observatory
[Gemini Observatory Archive](https://archive.gemini.edu/searchform/): For raw and reduced data products from the Gemini Observatory

### Gran Telescopia Canarias
[GTC Archive](http://gtc.sdc.cab.inta-csic.es/gtc/index.jsp): For raw and reduced data products of the GTC.
