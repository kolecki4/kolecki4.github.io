### About Me
I'm currently working as a researcher at The Ohio State University, where I completed my B.S. in Astronomy and Astrophysics with a minor in Computational and Informational Sciences in December of 2020.

My research interests revolve around the field of exoplanets: discovering and characterizing them as well as their host stars. I find it incredibly interesting to imagine how similar or dissimilar other planetary systems are when compared to our own solar system. 

My projects thus far have focused on getting metallicity and elemental abundance data for stars using spectroscopy. Some of the larger pieces of code I've written which I've considered quite useful are listed below. 

### List of Projects
As I continue my time in the field of Astronomy, I've realized how difficult it is to find certain useful things, whether it be code repositories, data archives, or other, without some serious digging. This is a list of websites that I hope will make the lives of those not already familiar with them much easier.
